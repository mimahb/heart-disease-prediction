# heart-disease-prediction
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. This project utilizes classification models to identify high-risk individuals, aiding in early detection and intervention.

## Features
Predictive Model: Predicts the risk of heart disease (1 = High Risk, 0 = Low Risk).
Feature Engineering: Utilizes categorical encoding and feature scaling for better model performance.
Interactive Visualizations: Displays relationships between features and the target variable.
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 91% on the test dataset.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

## Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved:

Accuracy: 91%
Precision: 0.90
Recall: 0.86
F1-Score: 0.88
Visualizations like correlation heatmaps and feature importance charts highlight the key predictors of heart disease.
